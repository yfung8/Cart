Shopping Cart Exercise with Strapi

About: React is used for this application and Strapi is used as the back end database. Strapi project specific database must be created/initialed via http://localhost1337. Postman is being utilized as the API tool for this Project.

The Assignment: 

Create a basic react shopping cart application. Functionality includes:
1. A listing of initial products that can be added to the "cart." Clicking on items adds the slected item to the current cart and subtracts from the "instock" quantity listed.
2. Current cart items--items selected from teh product list are moved to the current cart list. Clicking on the item opens up and additional description of the country of the product origin. Clicking the additional description allows the user to remove the item from the cart and adds it back to the inventory "instock quantity" over in the product listing. 
3. Restock button--when clicked, additional items in stock within the Strapi data base will be added to the Product list for purchase.
4. Checkout showing each item in the cart for purchase and a running total at the top of the cost of all items for checkout. Clicking the "Checkout" button clears pops up a message for the user that checkout has been completed and reset set the page for the next user.

Future Roadmap

A. Improve functionality to combine the restock quantities from Strapi that already exist on the product list to display as a single entry.
B. Allow users to select which items they need restocked/query if that item is available for restocking.
